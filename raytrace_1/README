Raytracer - Assignment 1
------------------------
For this assignment, we implemented all features mentioned in the requirements, namely:

- Raycasting with spheres & Phong illumination
- Additional geometry and meshes

The following shapes are currently implemented:

- Spheres
- Triangles
- Cylinders
- Cones

Using our triangle implementation, our program can trace object files (i.e. bags of triangles).
An example of this feature is shown in one of the screenshots, where a cat is traced.

Lastly, we added screenshots of all shapes, as well as a few scenes combining various shapes.
