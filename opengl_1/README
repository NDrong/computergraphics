OpenGL - Assignment 1
------------------------
For this assignment, we implemented all features mentioned in the requirements, namely:

- Shape drawing
- Transformations
- Scaling and rotation
- Object loading

The three objects can be scaled and rotated using the controls provided in the GUI.
We implemented these features mostly in our SceneObject class, such that code can be reused easily.

Futhermore, as a bonus, we implemented unitization in the Model class, allowing models to be unitized
automatically when loaded through our SceneObject class method createFromModelResource.
